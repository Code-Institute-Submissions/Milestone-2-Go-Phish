                    <h1>What is Phishing?</h1>
                    <p>Phishing is a cyber attack that uses disguised email as a weapon. The goal is to trick the email
                        recipient into believing that the message is something they want or need — a request from their
                        bank, for instance, or a note from someone in their company — and to click a link or download an
                        attachment.</p>

                    <p>What really distinguishes phishing is the form the message takes: the attackers masquerade as a
                        trusted entity of some kind, often a real or plausibly real person, or a company the victim
                        might do business with. It's one of the oldest types of cyberattacks, dating back to the 1990s,
                        and it's still one of the most widespread and pernicious, with phishing messages and techniques
                        becoming increasingly sophisticated.</p>

                    <h3>Deceptive</h3>
                    <p>Deceptive phishing is by far the most common type of phishing
                        scam. In this ploy, fraudsters impersonate a legitimate company in an attempt to steal
                        people’s personal data or login credentials. Those emails frequently use threats and a
                        sense of urgency to scare users into doing what the attackers want.</p>
                    <p>Many attackers attempt to evade detection from email filters by incorporating legitimate links
                        into their deceptive phishing emails. They could do this by including legitimate contact
                        information for an organization that they might be spoofing.
                        Blend malicious and benign code: Those responsible for creating phishing landing pages commonly
                        blend malicious and benign code together to fool Exchange Online Protection (EOP). This might
                        take the form of replicating the CSS and JavaScript of a tech giant’s login page in a bid to
                        steal users’ account credentials.</p>

                    <h3>Spear Fishing</h3>
                    <p>Not all phishing scams embrace “spray and pray” techniques. Some
                        ruses rely more on a personal touch. They do so because they wouldn’t be successful
                        otherwise. Enter spear phishing schemes.</p>
                    <p> In this type of ploy, fraudsters customize their attack emails with the target’s
                        name,
                        position, company, work phone number and other information in an attempt to trick
                        the
                        recipient into believing that they have a connection with the sender. Yet the goal
                        is
                        the same as deceptive phishing: trick the victim into clicking on a malicious URL or
                        email attachment so that they’ll hand over their personal data. Given the amount of
                        information needed to craft a convincing attack attempt, it’s no surprise that
                        spear-phishing is commonplace on social media sites like LinkedIn where attackers
                        can
                        use multiple data sources to craft a targeted attack email.</p>

                    <h3>Executive Fraud</h3>
                    <p>Spear phishers can target anyone in an organization, even executives. That’s the
                        logic behind a “whaling” attack. In these scams, fraudsters try to harpoon an exec
                        and steal their login details.</p>
                    <p>In the event their attack proves successful, fraudsters can choose to conduct
                        executive
                        fraud. As the second phase of a business email compromise (BEC) scam, executive
                        fraud is
                        when attackers abuse the compromised email account of a CEO or other high-ranking
                        executive to authorize fraudulent wire transfers to a financial institution of their
                        choice. Alternatively, they can leverage that same email account to conduct W-2
                        phishing in which they request W-2 information for all employees so that they can
                        file fake tax returns on their behalf or post that data on the dark web.</p>

                    <h3>Vishing</h3>
                    <p>Until now, we’ve discussed phishing attacks that for the most part rely solely on
                        email as a means of communication. Email is undoubtedly a popular tool among
                        phishers. Even so, fraudsters do sometimes turn to other media to perpetrate their
                        attacks.</p>

                    <p>Take vishing, for example. This type of phishing attack dispenses with sending out an
                        email and instead goes for placing a phone call. As noted by Comparitech, an
                        attacker can perpetrate a vishing campaign by setting up a Voice over Internet
                        Protocol (VoIP) server to mimic various entities in order to steal sensitive data
                        and/or funds.</p>

                    <h3>Smishing</h3>
                    <p>Vishing isn’t the only type of phishing that digital fraudsters
                        can perpetrate using a phone. They can also conduct what’s known as smishing. This
                        method leverages malicious text messages to trick users into clicking on a malicious
                        link or handing over personal information.</p>
                    <p> Attackers can use malicious links to trigger the automatic download of malicious apps on
                        victims’ mobile devices. Those apps could then deploy ransomware or enable nefarious actors to
                        remotely control their devices. Attackers could leverage a text message along with deceptive
                        phishing techniques to trick users into clicking a malicious link. The campaign could then
                        redirect them to a website designed to steal their personal information.</p>

                    <h3>Pharming</h3>
                    <p>As users become wiser to traditional phishing scams, some fraudsters are abandoning
                        the idea of “baiting” their victims entirely. Instead, they are resorting to
                        pharming. This method of phishing leverages cache poisoning against the domain name
                        system (DNS), a naming system which the Internet uses to convert alphabetical
                        website names, such as “www.microsoft.com,” to numerical IP addresses so that it can
                        locate and thereby direct visitors to computer services and devices.</p>

                    <p>In a DNS cache poisoning attack, a pharmer targets a DNS server and changes the IP
                        address associated with an alphabetical website name. That means an attacker can
                        redirect users to a malicious website of their choice. That’s the case even if the
                        victim enters the correct site name.</p>
